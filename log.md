### Day 14: June 7, 2019

**Plans for Today** Plan to continue with the library catalogue app from Mozilla's Django tutorial.

**Today's Progress**: Changed displays, added items, columns, filters, inline views, etc into the Django admin page

**Thoughts:** I wanted to add an inline view for the book on the authors admin page but I can't since I set the relationship as ManyToMany to account for multiple author books. Still thinking about what I want to change from the tutorial. I don't need author dates; I want subjects instead of genres, want LC numbers
